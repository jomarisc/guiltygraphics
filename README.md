## Conceptual Description (Why):
The Guilty Gear series as a whole is a sort of legacy franchise within the fighting game community. Older titles were known for their detailed sprites, immersive backgrounds, impressive soundtracks, and hardcore gameplay. However, the series has continued to raise the bar with a shift from 2D art style to a 3D one while still maintaining the original aesthetic. Through the use of cell shading, Guilty Gear is able to present its 3D models of iconic characters as if they were 2D sprites. The most recent game, GG Strive, is perhaps the best example of how refined its use of cell shading has come. Capturing the unique look of the franchise by employing cell shading is the main goal for this group. We will be modeling weapons or other interesting objects that belong to specific characters, applying the shading these newer games have, and placing them within a simple background.

## Technical Description (How):
The program that we will be using in order to model the various objects will be Blender. The main reason for this is primarily because it is free and offers basically any tool we would ever need for this specific project. Once we have the models completed, we can render them within Unity. The entire project will essentially be a non-moving scene. The schedule that we have planned is fairly straightforward. Week 7 is essentially dedicated to getting the models done and importing them into Unity. Week 8 would be where we create the shaders necessary to mimic the look that we want. Weeks 9 - 10 would be used to finalize any polish we had in mind such as minor corrections and adjustments to the shader/models.

## Main Challenges (What):
The biggest challenge would probably be the overall lack of experience with certain software. However, there are several challenges that are presented to this group which all vary depending on the member. For some, this class is their first experience with Unity and shaders. Others have never tried their hand at 3D modeling. Altogether, none of us have ever tried creating a shader that can mimic cell shading.

## Work Distribution:
3D Models: 1 for each group member. Cell Shading: All 3
